Overview
========
a script for semi-manual tracking of object (pollen tube) movement in 2D & time
and kymogram extraction

Functionality
=============

1. Registers multiple movie channels coherently based on one (most stable channel).

2. Based on the path of the object tracked manually by the user on 2D (x,y), returns:

- a kymogram [dimensions: (r,t)]

- 2D (r,t) path of the object on the kymogram as a ImageJ ROI

3. Based on the obtained 2D paths in (x,y) and (r,t) surfaces,
returns 3D (x,y,t) path.

4. Given a 3D path and the object radius (and possibly an r[x,y]-lag), 
returns a mask and applies to the original movie. 
This yields a signal in the object as a time course.
      

Inputs
======
a TIFF movie and the object's 2D path in ImageJ ROI format are taken as input


Output
======
a kymogram
